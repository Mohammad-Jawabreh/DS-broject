Project Description:
This project was created and developed by Mohammad Suleiman Jabarah and Mohammad Badi Ayasrah. It focuses on simulating and analyzing employee data for an IT company in France. The goal is to generate realistic data for 200 employees and perform detailed analyses to uncover insights regarding salaries, productivity, and geographical performance.

Tools and Libraries Used:
1. Libraries:
NumPy: For generating random data such as ages, salaries, and monthly revenue.
Pandas: To create, manipulate, and analyze the DataFrame.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For creating detailed visualizations to better understand the data.
2. Included Data:
Employee ID, name, age, position, salary, monthly revenue generated, years of experience, and location.
3. Key Steps:
Data Generation: Using NumPy to create realistic random data.
Data Analysis: Utilizing Pandas for insights like average salaries and total revenue based on position and location.
Data Visualization: Employing Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize the data through graphs and charts.
4. Data Saving:
All generated data was saved in an organized Excel file named employee_data.xlsx.

Project Goals:
1. Simulate Data for a French IT Company: To create a realistic dataset containing employee details.
2. Perform Data Analysis:
Calculate average salaries and monthly revenues by job position.
Determine total revenues generated by different locations.
3. Generate Visual Reports:
Salary distribution.
Average salary and revenue by position.
Revenue contribution by location.
